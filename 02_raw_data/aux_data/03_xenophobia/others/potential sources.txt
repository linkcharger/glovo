	- seems to be exactly what we want, but only PDF reports, no data
	- maybe have to write them and initiate a partnership

	- the lastest report (https://rm.coe.int/fifth-report-on-spain/16808b56c9) states that there are extensive statistics for hate speech and hate crime, but where?

https://hatecrime.osce.org/index.php/incidents?country=ES
	- manually reported hate crimes - very limited, no location as far as i can see

https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2017/second-european-union-minorities-and-discrimination-survey-main-results#publication-tab-1
	- survey exists, but doesnt have the resolution i think


maybe: Carlota Sol√©: The labor market and racial discrimination in Spain ( Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies , 2003)
	- but: old




================ other things i've tried ==============
	- hospital admissions and discharges (looking for hate crime injuries)
	- deaths by hate crime or nationality
	- 



next: scholarly articles on discrimination/xenophobia/hate crimes in spain
